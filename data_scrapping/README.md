Data that a conversational model will require would contain a format like:

```json
[
  {
    "dialogue_id": "1",
    "conversation": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hi, can you recommend a good restaurant nearby?"
      },
      {
        "role": "bot",
        "content": "Sure! What type of cuisine are you in the mood for?"
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I'm in the mood for Italian."
      },
      {
        "role": "bot",
        "content": "Great choice! There's a nice Italian restaurant called 'Pasta Paradise' nearby."
      }
    ],
    "intent": "restaurant_recommendation",
    "context": {
      "location": "current_location",
      "user_preferences": {
        "cuisine": "Italian"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "dialogue_id": "2",
    "conversation": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What's the weather like tomorrow?"
      },
      {
        "role": "bot",
        "content": "Tomorrow's forecast is sunny with a high of 25Â°C."
      }
    ],
    "intent": "weather_inquiry",
    "context": {
      "location": "current_location"
    }
  },
  // Additional dialogues...
]
```

Something like this has to be generated from a documentation website. The closest I could think of is, using the headline texts as prompts and adding a few "w" words as prefixes and producing more combinations out of it:

For each dialogue, we'd need `dialogue_id`, `conversation`, `intent` and `context`:

1. `dialogue_id`: can be generated easily based on the index of the prompt
2. `conversation`: List of conversations:
    - Depends on the nested headlines, starts from h1 to hX
    - Example:
    - role: "user" with content that of h1 (title)
    - role: "bot" with content under h1 (except any nested hXs where X < 1)
    - role: "user" with content that of h2 (title)
    - role: "bot" with content under h2 (except any nested hXs where X < 2)
    ... and so on
3. `intent`: need to figure out
4. `context`: do we need this?
